# Python - NBA Web Scrapping and Data Analysis Project 

Welcome to my NBA player data analysis portfolio project! In this project, I embarked on the fascinating world of professional basketball to uncover insights and trends hidden within the vast amounts of data surrounding NBA players. Basketball enthusiasts and data enthusiasts alike will find this project both informative and engaging as we explore various aspects of player performance, team dynamics, and statistical trends across different seasons.
The first step was to collect the necessary information to analyze. I found a good reputable basketball website and web scrapped the website to collect all the information about the 2022 season.

After collecting and rearranging the information for a better analysis I saved it into a CSV, which you can also find attached to the project. 

A few of the findings that were quite interesting to me were:

1-	It's intriguing to note that while the mean age of NBA players stands at 26 years old, the age with the highest representation of athletes is 24. This observation hints at an interesting trend within the demographics of professional basketball players. With the age distribution skewed towards younger players, it suggests a left-skewed curve, indicating a higher concentration of players in the younger age brackets. This phenomenon underscores the NBA's status as a league that often attracts and nurtures emerging talent, with many players making their mark on the court at a relatively young age.

2 - It's intriguing to note that the correlation between NBA players and points is more aligned with the volume of field goals attempted (FGA) rather than three-point attempts. This observation may seem counterintuitive, especially considering the modern trend towards increased three-point shooting in the game. However, it underscores an interesting aspect of player performance. Additionally, this trend is further validated by the fact that, on average, two-point attempts yield a higher success rate compared to three-point attempts, as highlighted in the subsequent point.

3 - Point per shot serves as a crucial metric for analyzing the differences between two-point and three-point shots. By calculating the average shooting percentage for each shot type (50.55% for two-pointers and 30.34% for three-pointers) and multiplying it by the respective points awarded (2 and 3), we gain valuable insights. Interestingly, we find that the difference in point per shot is narrower than what is observed with shooting percentages alone. Despite the growing emphasis on three-point shooting in the modern game, the data suggests that, on average, two-pointers remain more consistent and impactful. It's worth noting that these observations are generalized trends across the NBA and do not account for individual player or team dynamics. Nonetheless, they shed light on the enduring efficacy of two-point shots in basketball, even in an era marked by the rise of the three-pointer.

Overall, this project offers a glimpse into the intricate world of NBA player data analysis, showcasing the multifaceted nature of the sport and its statistical underpinnings. While our analysis provides valuable insights into generalized trends across the NBA, it's essential to recognize the individual nuances of players and teams that shape the game's dynamics. As basketball continues to evolve, so too will the analytics that drives our understanding of the sport, making projects like this a vital tool for enthusiasts and analysts alike.
